## RestoreAllWindows is a Window Manager, allowing bulk restore/minimize functionality removed from Windows 11!

RestoreAllWindows recreates functionality that has been a part of Windows for two decades, that has now been removed from Windows 11.
Starting with Windows Vista, it has been possible to right click a minimized application and either minimize or restore all the windows belonging to that specific application.

However, sadly that is no longer possible with Windows 11.

Using RestoreAllWindows, you are once again able to bulk minimize or restore all Windows for a specific program.

Clicking or right clicking the RestoreAllWindows system tray icon <img width="68" height="65" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b70e845-8c6e-4ce6-8a2e-defda47e8a7d" />

allows opening up the main Window Manager graphical interface or Restoring/Minimizing all Windows,.
